MAKEFLAGS="-j" conda-build recipe/meta.yaml


This builds a binary package that is no python specific - so one per platform is enough. And we currently do this just for linux.

For now this goes into the test channel:

anaconda upload anaconda3/envs/xxx/conda-bld/linux-64/libjpeg-turbo-xxx.tar.bz2 -u fastai --label test
