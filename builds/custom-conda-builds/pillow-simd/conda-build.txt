Mostly the same (some important) notes appli as in ../simd/conda-build.txt


## Successful Builds

w/ custom-built `libjpeg-turbo` + libtiff conda packages (via builds/custom-conda-builds/libjpeg-turbo and builds/custom-conda-builds/libtiff):

* python 3.6 + pillow-simd-dev (5.3.0.post0)



## Failing Builds

* python 3.7 failing + any pillow (except current Pillow master HEAD, which works, but Pillow-SIMD is not syncing it until a new release).
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '_sysconfigdata_x86_64_conda_cos6_linux_gnu'

## Prep

sudo apt-get install libjpeg-dev zlib1g-dev
conda install -y conda-build conda-verify
cd builds/custom-conda-builds/pillow-simd # this dir
git clone https://github.com/uploadcare/pillow-simd/ Pillow-SIMD
cd Pillow-SIMD
# optionally switch to a desired release tag, otherwise you're on the bleeding edge
# git checkout tags/5.3.0
cp -r ../recipe .

# apply patches:

1. only if pillow-simd < 5.4.0 - once pillow-simd 5.4.0.postX is released we don't need this patch anymore
git apply ../libjpeg-turbo-feature.patch

2. Make it possible to turn Pillow-SIMD package into Pillow package (if env var REPLACEPILLOW=1 during package build)
git apply ../pretend-pill-package.patch



## Build against a custom build libjpeg-turbo conda package

conda uninstall -y --force pillow pil jpeg libtiff
pip   uninstall -y         pillow pil jpeg libtiff


# presumes libjpeg-turbo libtiff were built locally - see
# builds/custom-conda-builds/libjpeg-turbo and
# builds/custom-conda-builds/libtiff
conda install -c ${CONDA_PREFIX}/conda-bld/ libjpeg-turbo libtiff
# or if they are already on fastai:
conda install -c fastai/label/test libjpeg-turbo libtiff


python setup.py sdist
CFLAGS="${CFLAGS} -mavx2" MAKEFLAGS="-j" conda-build -c fastai recipe/meta.yaml
# add REPLACEPILLOW=1 to make into Pillow package


### Build against -c conda-forge libjpeg-turbo

XXX: outdated - probably don't need any more?

conda uninstall -y --force pillow pil jpeg libtiff
pip   uninstall -y         pillow pil jpeg libtiff

conda install -y -c conda-forge libjpeg-turbo

python setup.py sdist
CFLAGS="${CFLAGS} -mavx2" MAKEFLAGS="-j" conda-build -c conda-forge recipe/meta.yaml



## Install

conda install -c ${CONDA_PREFIX}/conda-bld/ pillow-simd

# need to add the build channel as highest priority, otherwise the
# package will get overridden with `conda install pillow` or any other
# install/update that depends on pillow.
conda config --prepend channels ${CONDA_PREFIX}/conda-bld/
# this is for local use - if this package ends up on the `fastai`
# conda channel, then this should be done instead:
# conda config --prepend channels fastai




## Check

python -m fastai.utils.check_perf


# list out the active channels and their priorities
conda config --get channels


## Upload to fastai's anaconda channel

Probably start with label/test:

anaconda upload anaconda3/envs/xxx/conda-bld/linux-64/libjpeg-turbo-xxx.tar.bz2 -u fastai --label test
anaconda upload anaconda3/envs/xxx/conda-bld/linux-64/pillow-simd.tar.bz2 -u fastai --label test

and to install from the test label:

conda uninstall -y pillow libjpeg-turbo
conda install -c fastai/label/test pillow-simd
