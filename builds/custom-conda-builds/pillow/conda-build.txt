## Info

This conda recipe is based on:
https://github.com/conda-forge/pillow-feedstock

## Successful Builds

w/ custom-built `libjpeg-turbo` + libtiff conda packages (via builds/custom-conda-builds/libjpeg-turbo and builds/custom-conda-builds/libtiff):

* python 3.6 + pillow-dev (5.4.0.dev git HEAD)
* python 3.7 + pillow-dev (5.4.0.dev git HEAD)

w/ `-c conda-forge libjpeg-turbo` (bad idea though because it taps into a whole pile of packages from `conda-forge`

* python 3.6 + pillow-dev (5.4.0.dev git HEAD)


## Failing Builds

w/ `-c conda-forge libjpeg-turbo`:

* python 3.6 + pillow 5.3.0 somehow forces tk in, which relies on `jpeg` - a no go w/o additional investigation!
* python 3.7 failing + any pillow

## Prep

conda install -y conda-build conda-verify
cd builds/custom-conda-builds/pillow # this dir
git clone https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow Pillow
cd Pillow
# optionally switch to a desired release tag, otherwise you're on the bleeding edge
# git checkout tags/5.3.0
cp -r ../recipe .


## Build

Can build against the conda-forge libjpeg-turbo, or against a locally built one (the latter is much better)

### Build against a custom build libjpeg-turbo and libtiff conda packages

conda uninstall -y --force pillow pil jpeg libtiff
pip   uninstall -y         pillow pil jpeg libtiff

# presumes libjpeg-turbo libtiff were built locally - see
# builds/custom-conda-builds/libjpeg-turbo and
# builds/custom-conda-builds/libtiff
conda install -c ${CONDA_PREFIX}/conda-bld/ libjpeg-turbo libtiff
# or if they are already on fastai:
conda install -c fastai/label/test libjpeg-turbo libtiff


python setup.py sdist
MAKEFLAGS="-j" conda-build -c fastai recipe/meta.yaml


### Build against -c conda-forge libjpeg-turbo

XXX: outdated - probably don't need any more?

(Alternative build)

conda uninstall -y --force pillow pil jpeg libtiff
pip   uninstall -y         pillow pil jpeg libtiff

conda install -y -c conda-forge libjpeg-turbo

python setup.py sdist
MAKEFLAGS="-j" conda-build -c conda-forge recipe/meta.yaml



## Install

conda install -c ${CONDA_PREFIX}/conda-bld/ pillow

# need to add the build channel as highest priority, otherwise the
# package will get overridden with `conda install pillow` or any other
# install/update that depends on pillow.
conda config --prepend channels ${CONDA_PREFIX}/conda-bld/
# this is for local use - if this package ends up on the `fastai`
# conda channel, then this should be done instead:
# conda config --prepend channels fastai




## Check

python -m fastai.utils.check_perf


# list out the active channels and their priorities
conda config --get channels


## Upload to fastai's anaconda channel

Probably start with label/test:

anaconda upload anaconda3/envs/xxx/conda-bld/linux-64/libjpeg-turbo-xxx.tar.bz2 -u fastai --label test
anaconda upload anaconda3/envs/xxx/conda-bld/linux-64/pillow-xxx.tar.bz2 -u fastai --label test

and to install from the test label:

conda uninstall -y pillow libjpeg-turbo
conda install -c fastai/label/test pillow
