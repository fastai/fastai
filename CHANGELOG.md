# Release notes

<!-- do not remove -->

## 2.0.15

### Breaking Changes

- loss functions were moved to `loss.py` ([#2843](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/pull/2810))


## 2.0.14

### New Features

- new callback event: `after_create` ([#2842](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/issues/2842))
  - This event runs after a `Learner` is constructed. It's useful for initial setup which isn't needed for every `fit`, but just once for each `Learner` (such as setting initial defaults).

- Modified XResNet to support Conv1d / Conv3d ([#2744](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/pull/2744)), thanks to [@floleuerer](https://github.com/floleuerer)
  - Supports different input dimensions, kernel sizes and stride (added parameters ndim, ks, stride). Tested with fastai_audio and fastai time series with promising results.

### Bugs Squashed

- `img_size` attribute for `TensorPoint` is not updated properly ([#2799](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/pull/2799)), thanks to [@IRailean](https://github.com/IRailean)

## 2.0.13

### Bugs Squashed

- Undo breaking num_workers fix ([#2804](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/pull/2804))
  - Some users found the recent addition of `num_workers` to inference
    functions was causing problems, particularly on Windows. This PR
    reverts that change, until we find a more reliable way to handle
    `num_workers` for inference.
- learn.tta() fails on a learner imported with load_learner() ([#2764](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/issues/2764))
- learn.summary() crashes out on 2nd transfer learning ([#2735](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/issues/2735))

## 2.0.12

### Bugs Squashed

- Undo breaking `num_workers` fix ([#2804](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/pull/2804))

## 2.0.11

### Bugs Squashed

- Fix `cont_cat_split` for multi-label classification ([#2759](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/issues/2759))
- fastbook error: "index 3 is out of bounds for dimension 0 with size 3" ([#2792](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/issues/2792))

## 2.0.10

### New Features

- update for fastcore 1.0.5 ([#2775](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/issues/2775))

## 2.0.6

### New Features

- "Remove pandas min version requirement" ([#2765](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/issues/2765))
- Modify XResNet to support Conv1d / Conv3d ([#2744](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/issues/2744))
  - Also support different input dimensions, kernel sizes and stride (added parameters ndim, ks, stride).
- Add support for multidimensional arrays for RNNDropout ([#2737](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/issues/2737))
- MCDropoutCallback to enable Monte Carlo Dropout in fastai. ([#2733](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/issues/2733))
  - A new callback to enable Monte Carlo Dropout in fastai in the `get_preds` method.
    Monte Carlo Dropout is simply enabling dropout during inference.
    Calling get_preds multiple times and stacking them yield of a distribution of predictions that you can use to evaluate your prediction uncertainty.
- adjustable workers in `get_preds` ([#2721](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/issues/2721))

## Version 2.0.0

- Initial release of v2
