- make native fp16 extensible with callbacks ([#3094](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/issues/3094))

## 2.1.3

### Bugs Squashed

- Work around broken PyTorch subclassing of some `new_*` methods ([#2769](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/issues/2769))


## 2.1.0

### New Features

- PyTorch 1.7 compatibility ([#2917](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/issues/2917))

PyTorch 1.7 includes support for tensor subclassing, so we have replaced much of our custom subclassing code with PyTorch's. We have seen a few bugs in PyTorch's subclassing feature, however, so please file an issue if you see any code failing now which was working before.

There is one breaking change in this version of fastai, which is that custom metadata is now stored directly in tensors as standard python attributes, instead of in the special `_meta` attribute. Only advanced customization of fastai OO tensors would have used this functionality, so if you do not know what this all means, then it means you did not use it.


## 2.0.19

This version was released *after* `2.1.0`, and adds fastcore 1.3 compatibility, whilst maintaining PyTorch 1.6 compatibility. It has no new features or bug fixes.


## 2.0.18

### Forthcoming breaking changes

The next version of fastai will be 2.1. It will require PyTorch 1.7, which has significant foundational changes. It should not require any code changes except for people doing sophisticated tensor subclassing work, but nonetheless we recommend testing carefully. Therefore, we recommend pinning your fastai version to `<2.1` if you are not able to fully test your fastai code when the new version comes out.

### Dependencies

- pin pytorch (`<1.7`) and torchvision (`<0.8`) requirements ([#2915](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/issues/2915))
- Add version pin for fastcore
- Remove version pin for sentencepiece


## 2.0.16

### New Features

- added support for tb projector word embeddings ([#2853](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/pull/2853)), thanks to [@floleuerer](https://github.com/floleuerer)
- Added ability to have variable length draw ([#2845](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/pull/2845)), thanks to [@marii-moe](https://github.com/marii-moe)
- add pip upgrade cell to all notebooks, to ensure colab has current fastai version ([#2843](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/issues/2843))

### Bugs Squashed

- fix TabularDataLoaders inference of cont_names to keep y_names separate ([#2859](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/pull/2859)), thanks to [@sutt](https://github.com/sutt)


## 2.0.15

### Breaking Changes

- loss functions were moved to `loss.py` ([#2843](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/pull/2810))


## 2.0.14

### New Features

- new callback event: `after_create` ([#2842](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/issues/2842))
  - This event runs after a `Learner` is constructed. It's useful for initial setup which isn't needed for every `fit`, but just once for each `Learner` (such as setting initial defaults).

- Modified XResNet to support Conv1d / Conv3d ([#2744](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/pull/2744)), thanks to [@floleuerer](https://github.com/floleuerer)
  - Supports different input dimensions, kernel sizes and stride (added parameters ndim, ks, stride). Tested with fastai_audio and fastai time series with promising results.

### Bugs Squashed

- `img_size` attribute for `TensorPoint` is not updated properly ([#2799](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/pull/2799)), thanks to [@IRailean](https://github.com/IRailean)

## 2.0.13

### Bugs Squashed

- Undo breaking num_workers fix ([#2804](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/pull/2804))
  - Some users found the recent addition of `num_workers` to inference
    functions was causing problems, particularly on Windows. This PR
    reverts that change, until we find a more reliable way to handle
    `num_workers` for inference.
- learn.tta() fails on a learner imported with load_learner() ([#2764](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/issues/2764))
- learn.summary() crashes out on 2nd transfer learning ([#2735](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/issues/2735))

## 2.0.12

### Bugs Squashed

- Undo breaking `num_workers` fix ([#2804](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/pull/2804))

## 2.0.11

### Bugs Squashed

- Fix `cont_cat_split` for multi-label classification ([#2759](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/issues/2759))
- fastbook error: "index 3 is out of bounds for dimension 0 with size 3" ([#2792](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/issues/2792))

## 2.0.10

### New Features

- update for fastcore 1.0.5 ([#2775](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/issues/2775))

## 2.0.6

### New Features

- "Remove pandas min version requirement" ([#2765](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/issues/2765))
- Modify XResNet to support Conv1d / Conv3d ([#2744](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/issues/2744))
  - Also support different input dimensions, kernel sizes and stride (added parameters ndim, ks, stride).
- Add support for multidimensional arrays for RNNDropout ([#2737](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/issues/2737))
- MCDropoutCallback to enable Monte Carlo Dropout in fastai. ([#2733](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/issues/2733))
  - A new callback to enable Monte Carlo Dropout in fastai in the `get_preds` method.
    Monte Carlo Dropout is simply enabling dropout during inference.
    Calling get_preds multiple times and stacking them yield of a distribution of predictions that you can use to evaluate your prediction uncertainty.
- adjustable workers in `get_preds` ([#2721](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/issues/2721))

## Version 2.0.0

- Initial release of v2
