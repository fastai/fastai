<h2 id="Getting-Started">Getting Started<a class="anchor-link" href="#Getting-Started"> </a></h2><p>First you should quickly watch the introductory stream HERE. It will quickly catch you up to speed on how to contribute to the library, what the overall sprint will look like, as well as the recommended way to create your first PR!</p>
<p>Below are quick TL;DR's of what is stated in the video, meant as a quick reminder plus important links.</p>

<p>More specifically, anyone and everyone is invited to come along and help with this endevor. No matter how much experience you have with coding or the library, with the exploratory aspect of this sprint and it being documentation focused, much of the library's insides will be new to folks and prone to discovery so absolutely come in and try it out!</p>

<h2 id="Communication">Communication<a class="anchor-link" href="#Communication"> </a></h2><p>Most of the repository of this sprint will live inside of the fastai <a href="https://discord.gg/3KmGsdMRFH">discord</a>. Inside, you can ping any of the senior members acting as guides throughout this sprint with any troubles, discuss the right way to approach a strange class, or just come say hi!</p>
<p>I (Zach Mueller) will also be commiting to streaming for 2-3 hours for at least 4-5 days a week in the evenings (around 6pm EST) inside the Discord, with a few streams in the early morning for folks in other timezones. To keep an ear out for when I stream either keep an eye on the discord, or follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/TheZachMueller">twitter</a>.</p>
