feedback: > 
  This is my feedback to you.
  Even if I include linebreaks here,
  all of the linebreaks will be removed when the value is inserted.
    
block: |
    This pipe does something a little different. 
    It preserves the breaks.
    This is really helpful for code samples, 
    since you can format the code samples with
       the appropriate
       white spacing.
