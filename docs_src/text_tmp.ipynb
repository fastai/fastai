       "    <th>i was xxunk enough to meet george pal ( and still have my xxunk : xxup xxunk poster xxunk by him ) at a convention shortly after the release , and asked him why he chose to do the film \" camp \" . before he could answer , two studio flacks xxunk and xxunk me on how the studio \" knew best \" and how \" no one will take such a film seriously \" . i had been reading the bantam xxunk for a couple of years thanks to a friend ( xxunk xxunk of the 1970s will recall xxunk and his band ? i was in a couple of years of that with him ) , and had higher hopes than what we got . \\n\\n the flacks xxunk that no high adventure would ever be done seriously , and so doing ' camp ' was the only way . several other fans xxunk in on my side , with pal listening as best he could . at the end of the little event , pal came up to us and xxunk , xxunk he could have done more and better . \\n\\n  xxup star xxup wars put the lie to the flacks , and a year after pal 's death , spielberg and lucas proved that doc savage could have easily been the next major movie franchise ... if it had n't been for the flacks . \\n\\n tear out the memory or history of doc , and the film would have been worth a 6 / 10 rating as nothing more than a mindless popcorn xxunk . \\n\\n but destroying the legacy like that was no less an xxunk than killing a baby in the xxunk . \\n\\n doc savage can still come to the screen , and survive the inevitable comparisons by the ill - informed to indiana jones , but it would have to be done in all xxunk and earnest to xxunk the glory that we should expect from the first american superhero . \\n\\n  xxup xxunk : yes , there was a second script for xxup xxunk of xxup evil , and it 's a lot more serious . yes , there was xxunk footage shot , but mostly establishing shots and very little with actors . and , yes , there _ is _ a one - xxunk of ron xxunk xxunk over a xxunk wall and xxunk at something over his shoulder with a specially built bronze xxunk . xxunk 's wearing a xxunk over a button down white shirt with a bronze tie , and the words \" xxup doc xxup savage : xxup xxunk of xxup evil ... coming next summer ! \" xxup xxunk : if anyone knows who the studio flacks were that accompanied george pal in 1975 to san xxunk for the convention , xxunk the idiots up the side of the head and call them the idiots that they are . at the time , they were doing xxunk and fu xxunk in xxunk and xxunk xxunk pants , and carrying xxunk xxunk .</th>\n",

       "    <th>this film is the xxunk effort of xxunk xxunk and her new production company . while it suffers from a few problems , as every low budget production does , it is a good start for ms . xxunk and her company . \\n\\n the story is not terribly new having been done in films like the burning and every friday the 13th since part 2 . but , the performances are xxunk . so many big budget movies just have the actors going through the xxunk , its always nice to see actors really trying to xxunk their craft . \\n\\n the story deals with the xxunk possible return ) of a disfigured xxunk . the others are xxunk to xxunk , but the xxunk of the event xxunk each person in different xxunk in their xxunk . ten years later , the friends are murdered one by one by a gruesome xxunk known as \" the xxunk \" . who will survive ? you have to watch . \\n\\n if you are roger ebert or any number of xxunk critics , you probably should n't bother . but if your taste run more towards joe bob xxunk and you want to see a group of people xxunk their craft , then check out \" the xxunk \" .</th>\n",
