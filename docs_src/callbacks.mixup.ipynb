    "This module contains the implementation of a data augmentation technique called [mixup](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09412). It is extremely efficient at regularizing models in computer vision (we used it to get our time to train CIFAR10 to 94% on one GPU to 6 minutes). \n",
    "\n",
    "As the name kind of suggests, the authors of the mixup article propose training the model on mixes of the training set images. For example, suppose we’re training on CIFAR10.  Instead of feeding the model the raw images, we take two images (not necessarily from the same class) and make a linear combination of them: in terms of tensors, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "`new_image = t * image1 + (1-t) * image2`\n",
    "\n",
    "where t is a float between 0 and 1. The target we assign to that new image is the same combination of the original targets:\n",
    "\n",
    "`new_target = t * target1 + (1-t) * target2`\n",
    "\n",
    "assuming the targets are one-hot encoded (which isn’t the case in PyTorch usually). And it's as simple as that.\n",

    "\n",
    "Dog or cat? The right answer here is 70% dog and 30% cat!\n",
    "\n",
    "As the picture above shows, it’s a bit hard for the human eye to make sense of images obtained in this way (although we do see the shapes of a dog and a cat). However, it somehow makes a lot of sense to the model, which trains more efficiently. One important side note is that when training with mixup, the final loss (training or validation) will be higher than when training without it, even when the accuracy is far better: a model trained like this will make predictions that are a bit less confident."

    "\n",
    "![betadist](imgs/betadist-mixup.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "meaning that there's a very high probability of picking values close to 0 or 1 (in which case the mixed up image is mostly from only one category) and then a somewhat constant, much smaller probability of picking something in the middle (notice that 0.33 is nearly as likely as 0.5, for instance).\n",
    "\n",
    "While this works very well, it’s not the fastest way, and this is the first suggestion we adjust. The unnecessary slowdown with this approach comes from drawing two different batches at every iteration, which means loading twice the number of images and additionally applying any other data augmentation functions to them. To avoid this, we apply mixup on a batch with a shuffled version of itself: this way, the images mixed up are still different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the same value of `t` for the whole batch is another suggestion we modify. In our experiments, we noticed that the model trained faster if we drew a different `t` for every image in the batch. (Both options got to the same result in terms of accuracy, it’s just that one arrived there more slowly.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, notice that with this strategy we might create duplicate images: let’s say we are mixing `image0` with `image1` and `image1` with `image0`, and that we draw `t=0.1` for the first mix and `t=0.9` for the second. Then\n",
