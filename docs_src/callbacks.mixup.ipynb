    "\n",
    "As the name kind of suggests, the authors of the mixup article propose to train the model on a mix of the pictures of the training set. Let’s say we’re on CIFAR10 for instance, then instead of feeding the model the raw images, we take two (which could be in the same class or not) and do a linear combination of them: in terms of tensor it’s\n",

The final loss (training or validation) will be higher than when training without mixup even if the accuracy is far better, which means that a model trained like this will make predictions that are a bit less confident."

    "so it means there is a very high probability of picking values close to 0 or 1 (in which case the image is almost from 1 category) and then a somewhat constant probability of picking something in the middle (0.33 as likely as 0.5 for instance).\n",
    "\n",
    "While this works very well, it’s not the fastest way we can do this and this is the first suggestion we will adjust. The main point that slows down this process is wanting two different batches at every iteration (which means loading twice the amount of images and applying to them the other data augmentation function). To avoid this slow down, ou be a little smarter and mixup a batch with a shuffled version of itself (this way the images mixed up are still different).\n",

    "Using the same parameter t for the whole batch is another suggestion we will modify. In our experiments, we noticed that the model can train faster if we draw a different `t` for every image in the batch (both options get to the same result in terms of accuracy, it’s just that one arrives there more slowly).\n",
    "The last trick we have to apply with this is that there can be some duplicates with this strategy: let’s say we decide to mix `image0` with `image1` then `image1` with `image0`, and that we draw `t=0.1` for the first, and `t=0.9` for the second. Then\n",
