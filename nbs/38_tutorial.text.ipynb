    "The pretrained model we used in the previous section is called a language model. It was pretrained on Wikipedia on the task of guessing the next word, after reading all the words before. We got great results by directly fine-tuning this language model to a movie review classifier, but with one extra step, we can do even better: the Wikipedia English is slightly different from the IMDb English. So instead of jumping directly to the classifier, we could fine-tune our pretrained language model to the IMDb corpus and *then* use that as the base for our classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "One reason, of course, is that it is helpful to understand the foundations of the models that you are using. But there is another very practical reason, which is that you get even better results if you fine tune the (sequence-based) language model prior to fine tuning the classification model. For instance, in the IMDb sentiment analysis task, the dataset includes 50,000 additional movie reviews that do not have any positive or negative labels attached in the unsup folder. We can use all of these reviews to fine tune the pretrained language model — this will result in a language model that is particularly good at predicting the next word of a movie review. In contrast, the pretrained model was trained only on Wikipedia articles.\n",
