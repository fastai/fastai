# unlike pypi, conda has a slightly different format for required

# space), for details see:

requirements:
  build:
    - conda-build

    - python

# skipped requirements:
# jupyter_contrib_nbextensions - only needed for internal tools - it's not on conda and requires too many of its own dependencies which aren't on conda either
# XXX: change pytorch-nightly to pytorch >=1.0.0 once it's released on conda
# XXX: change torchvision-nightly to torchvision >=0.2.2 once 0.2.2 (against pytorch-1.0) is released on conda
# XXX: temporarily pinning spacy and its dependencies (regex, thinc, and cymem) to have a stable environment during the course duration.
#
# note: "module # [py36]" tells conda-build that this requirement is only for python3.6, it's not a comment.

# removed these and instead are asking users to install those directly until a proper pytorch-1.0.0 and the corresponding torchvision are released on conda. otherwise can't support these two sets:
#    - pytorch-nightly
#    - torchvision-nightly
#
#    - pytorch-nightly-cpu
#    - torchvision-nightly-cpu

# removing until pytorch-1.0.0 release - conda can't handle these dependencies and tries to pull in pytorch-0.4.1 due to torchvision depending on it. yet, pytorch doesn't release torchvision nightly build... no way out
#    - pytorch >=1.0.0

# removing the loading test for now, since we temporarily made fastai conda package not depend on torch/torchvision due to dependencies hell - see above.

  # description needs to have:
  # - yaml multi-line format, so need to indent the text 4 spaces: replace("\n", "\n    ")
  # - can't have #, as it thinks it is a comment: replace("#", '\#')
  #   it won't render headers anyway, it expects underlined header syntax instead:
  #   HEADER
  #   ------
  # - _ is special outside of block code, need to escape otherwise, but can't do that w/o jinja2 regex support since it'll break code blocks - so doing nothing at the moment.
