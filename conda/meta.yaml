# unlike pypi, conda has a slightly different format for required

requirements:
  build:
    - conda-build
    - pytest-runner
    - python

# skipped requirements:
# jupyter_contrib_nbextensions - only needed for internal tools - it's not on conda and requires too many of its own dependencies which aren't on conda either
#
# note: since we don't make separate py36 and py37 fastai releases, the only way to preserve the `dataclasses` dependency when building the package with py37 is not
# have the # [py36] selector. `dataclasses` will be installed on py37 too, which is OK. Full details: https://docs.fast.ai/dev/release.html#the-problem-of-supporting-different-architectures
# same goes for `typing`

  # description needs to have:
  # - yaml multi-line format, so need to indent the text 4 spaces: replace("\n", "\n    ")
  # - can't have #, as it thinks it is a comment: replace("#", '\#')
  #   it won't render headers anyway, it expects underlined header syntax instead:
  #   HEADER
  #   ------
  # - _ is special outside of block code, need to escape otherwise, but can't do that w/o jinja2 regex support since it'll break code blocks - so doing nothing at the moment.
