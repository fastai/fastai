### normal dependencies ###
#
# IMPORTANT: when updating these, please make sure to sync conda/meta.yaml and docs/install.md (the "custom dependencies" section)
#
# these get resolved and installed via either of these two:
#
#   pip install fastai
#   pip install -e .
#
# dependencies to skip for now:
# - cupy - is only required for QRNNs - sgugger thinks later he will get rid of this dep.
#
# XXX: when spacy==2.0.18 is on anaconda channel, put it in place (it's already on pypi) and remove its deps: cymem, regex, thinc (and update meta.yaml with the same)

### developer dependencies ###
#
# anything else that's not required by a user to run the library, but
# either is an enhancement or a developer-build requirement goes here.
#
# the [dev] feature is documented here:
# https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#declaring-extras-optional-features-with-their-own-dependencies
#
# these, including the normal dependencies, get installed with:
#
#   pip install fastai[dev]
#
# or via an editable install:
#
#   pip install -e .[dev]
#
# some of the listed modules appear in test_requirements as well, as explained below.
