# fastai

The fastai deep learning library. See the [fastai website](http://docs.fast.ai) to get started.

### Conda Install

To install fastai with CUDA 9.2 simply run:

    conda install -c pytorch -c fastai fastai cuda92

If your setup doesn't have CUDA support remove the `cuda92` above (in which case you'll only be able to train on CPU, not GPU, which will be much slower). For different versions of the CUDA toolkit, you'll need to install the appropriate CUDA conda package based on what you've got installed on your system (i.e. instead of `cuda92` in the above, pick the appropriate option for whichever toolkit version you have installed; to see a list of options type: `conda search "cuda*" -c pytorch`).

NB: We are currently using a re-packaged torchvision in order to support pytorch-nightly, which is required for using fastai.

### PyPI Install

First install the nightly `pytorch` build, e.g. for CUDA 9.2:

    pip install torch_nightly -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu92/torch_nightly.html

If you have a different CUDA version find the right build [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). Choose Preview/Linux/Pip/python3.6|python3.7 and your CUDA version and it will give you the correct install instruction.

Now you can install `fastai`. Note, that this is a beta test version at the moment, please [report any issues](https://github.com/fastai/fastai_pytorch/issues/):

    pip install fastai==1.0.0b7

 Sometimes, the last `pip` command still tries to get `torch-0.4.1`. If that happens to you, do:

    pip uninstall torchvision fastai
    pip install --no-deps torchvision
    pip install fastai==1.0.0b7

### Developer Install

First, follow the instructions above for either `PyPi` or `Conda`. Then remove the fastai package (`pip uninstall fastai` or `conda uninstall fastai`) and replace it with a [pip editable install](http://codumentary.blogspot.com/2014/11/python-tip-of-year-pip-install-editable.html):

    git clone https://github.com/fastai/fastai
    cd fastai
    pip install -e .
    tools/run-after-git-clone
