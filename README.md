# fastai

The fastai library simplifies training fast and accurate neural nets using modern best practices. See the [fastai website](http://docs.fast.ai) to get started. The library is based on research in to deep learning best practices undertaken at [fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai), and includes \"out of the box\" support for [`vision`](http://docs.fast.ai/vision.html#vision), [`text`](http://docs.fast.ai/text.html#text), [`tabular`](http://docs.fast.ai/tabular.html#tabular), and [`collab`](http://docs.fast.ai/collab.html#collab) (collaborative filtering) models. For brief examples, see the [examples](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/tree/master/examples) folder; detailed examples are provided in the full documentation. For instance, here's how to train an MNIST model using [resnet18](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) (from the [vision example](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/blob/master/examples/vision.ipynb)):

```python
untar_data(MNIST_PATH)
data = image_data_from_folder(MNIST_PATH)
learn = ConvLearner(data, tvm.resnet18, metrics=accuracy)
learn.fit(1)
```

## Note for [course.fast.ai](http://course.fast.ai) students

If you are using `fastai` for any [course.fast.ai](http://course.fast.ai) course, you need to use `fastai 0.7.x`. Please ignore the rest of this document, which is written for `fastai 1.0.x`, and instead follow the installation instructions [here](http://forums.fast.ai/t/fastai-v0-install-issues-thread/24652).

*Note: If you want to learn how to use fastai v1 from its lead developer, Jeremy Howard, he will be teaching it in the [Deep Learning Part I](https://www.usfca.edu/data-institute/certificates/deep-learning-part-one) course at the University of San Francisco from Oct 22nd, 2018.*

## Installation

`fastai-1.x` can be installed with either `conda` or `pip` package managers and also from source. At the moment you can't just run *install*, since you first need to get the correct `pytorch` version installed - thus to get `fastai-1.x` installed choose one of the installation recipes below using your favourite python package manager.

If your system has a [recent NVIDIA card](https://www.geforce.com/hardware/technology/cuda/supported-gpus) with the correctly configured NVIDIA driver please follow the GPU installation instructions. Otherwise, the CPU-ones.

If you experience installation problems, please read about [installation issues](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/blob/master/README.md#installation-issues).


### Conda Install

* GPU

   ```
   conda install -c pytorch pytorch-nightly cuda92
   conda install -c fastai torchvision-nightly
   conda install -c fastai fastai
   ```

* CPU

   ```
   conda install -c pytorch pytorch-nightly-cpu
   conda install -c fastai torchvision-nightly-cpu
   conda install -c fastai fastai
   ```


### PyPI Install

* GPU

   ```
   pip install torch_nightly -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu92/torch_nightly.html
   pip install fastai
   ```

* CPU

   ```
   pip install torch_nightly -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cpu/torch_nightly.html
   pip install fastai
   ```

NB: this set will also fetch `torchvision-nightly`, which supports `torch-1.x`.



### Developer Install

First, follow the instructions above for either `PyPi` or `Conda`. Then uninstall the `fastai` package using the **same package manager you used to install it**, i.e. `pip uninstall fastai` or `conda uninstall fastai`, and then, replace it with a [pip editable install](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#editable-installs).


```
git clone https://github.com/fastai/fastai
cd fastai
tools/run-after-git-clone
pip install -e .[dev]
```

You can test that the build works by starting the jupyter notebook:

```
jupyter notebook
```
and executing an example notebook. For example load `examples/tabular.ipynb` and run it.

Alternatively, you can do a quick CLI test:

```
jupyter nbconvert --execute --ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=600 --to notebook examples/tabular.ipynb
```

If anything goes wrong please [read and report installation
issues](http://forums.fast.ai/t/fastai-v1-install-issues-thread/24111).

Please refer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and  [develop.md](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/blob/master/docs/develop.md) for more details on how to contribute to the `fastai` project.


## Installation Issues

If the installation process fails, first make sure [your system is supported](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/blob/master/README.md#is-my-system-supported). And if the problem is still not addressed, please see  [this installation issues thread](http://forums.fast.ai/t/fastai-v1-install-issues-thread/24111).

If you encounter installation problems with conda, make sure you have the latest `conda` client:
```
conda update conda
```

Sometimes you have to run the following instead:

```
conda install conda
```


### Is My System Supported?

1. Python: You need to have python 3.6 or higher

2. CPU or GPU

   The `pytorch` binary package comes with its own CUDA, CuDNN, NCCL, MKL, and other libraries so you don't have to install system-wide NVIDIA's CUDA and related libraries if you don't need them for something else. If you have them installed already it doesn't matter which NVIDIA's CUDA version library you have installed system-wide. Your system could have CUDA 9.0 libraries, and you can still use `pytorch` build with `cuda9.2` libraries without any problem, since the `pytorch` binary package is self-contained.

   The only requirement is that you have installed and configured the NVIDIA driver correctly. Usually you can test that by running `nvidia-smi`. While it's possible that this application is not available on your system, it's very likely that if it doesn't work, than your don't have your NVIDIA drivers configured properly. And remember that a reboot is always required after installing NVIDIA drivers.

   If you build `pytorch` from source then you will need to first install CUDA, CuDNN, and other required libraries. See [pytorch.org](https://pytorch.org/).

3. Operating System:

   Since fastai-1.0 relies on pytorch-1.0, you need to be able to install pytorch-1.0 first.

   As of this moment pytorch.org's pre-1.0.0 version (`torch-nightly`) supports:

    | Platform | GPU    | CPU    |
    | ---      | ---    | ---    |
    | linux    | binary | binary |
    | mac      | source | binary |
    | windows  | source | source |

   Legend: `binary` = can be installed directly, `source` = needs to be built from source.

   This will change once `pytorch` 1.0.0 is released and installable packages made available for your system, which could take some time after the official release is made. Please watch for updates [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

   If there is no `pytorch` preview conda or pip package available for your system, you may still be able to [build it from source](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

   Alternatively, please consider installing and using the very solid "0.7.x" version of `fastai`. Please see the [instructions](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/tree/master/old).
