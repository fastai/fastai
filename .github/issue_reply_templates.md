# Entries for Issue Replies

github allows for quick staple replies to the issues. Therefore please "install" the following staple replies to save yourself time, and also so that the answers by different developers are consistent.

Each developer, involved in addressing issues, needs to manually add those one by one to [his github account](https://github.com/settings/replies). Once configured, you will find them in the drop-down menu accessible from the right upper corner of the comment box inside the issue page.

Note that these staple replies are global for your github account, and aren't specific to `fastai` repository.

You may need to update these if the information, e.g. links, gets modified.
