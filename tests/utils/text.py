# When any function contains print() calls that get overwritten, like progress bars,
# a special care needs to be applied, since under pytest -s captured output (capsys
# or contextlib.redirect_stdout) contains any temporary printed strings, followed by
# \r's. This helper function ensures that the buffer will contain the same output
# with and without -s in pytest, by turning:
# foo bar\r tar mar\r final message
# into:
# final message
# it can handle a single string or a multiline buffer
